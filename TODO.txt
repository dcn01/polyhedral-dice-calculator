ISSUES
- allow only valid input (make a new parser that allows partial die expressions)
- disable interface when rolling dice
- [IPHONE WEB] when bookmarked to the homescreen, it loads a stale version

IMPROVEMENTS
- show rolling die in output part of the screen, not in the input part.
- choose a better calculator font.
- shiny glass buttons ;-)

NICE TO HAVE
- show analysis in expanded view / landscape (responsive design FTW!)
  - expected value
  - minimum value
  - maximum value
  - plot of chance distribution

- shake device to throw dice
- graphical representation of the type of die thrown
- splash screen using pixelfont

OTHER THINGS
- hook unittests into grunt
